csim 1 4 16 write-allocate write-back fifo < fifotest.trace
even though line 5 is the same for line 1, fifo should evict 0x00000010 after line 6
Such, line 7 will be a miss.
result should be only 1 hit(line 5).

For comparison.
csim 1 4 16 write-allocate write-back lru < fifotest.trace
result should be 2 hits(5 and 7).
